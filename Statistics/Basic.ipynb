    "SciPy provides a large number of functions that are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications. Many SciPy functions operate on numpy arrays. For this course, we will primarily be using the SciPy.Stats sub-module. SciPy.Stats calculates density and mass functions, cumulative distribution functions, and quantile functions for many probability distributions. We will use these functions in the second and third courses of this series when we do more formal statistical analysis. If you are not familiar with probability distributions you can skip this section.\n",
