    "### **What is One-Hot Encoding (OHE)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding is a way to **convert text categories or words into numerical vectors** using only 0s and 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each unique word or category becomes its own position (feature) in the vector.\n",
    "* The vector contains a `1` where the word/category is present and `0` elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use One-Hot Encoding?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning models need **numbers, not text**.\n",
    "* OHE is a **simple, straightforward method** to represent categorical data.\n",
    "* Useful when the vocabulary or categories are **small and fixed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Does One-Hot Encoding Work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a list of categories or words like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OHE creates vectors like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| apple | banana | orange |\n",
    "| ----- | ------ | ------ |\n",
    "| 1     | 0      | 0      |\n",
    "| 0     | 1      | 0      |\n",
    "| 0     | 0      | 1      |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use OHE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **categorical labels** (e.g., sentiment: positive, neutral, negative)\n",
    "* For **small vocabularies** when representing words\n",
    "* When you want a **simple, interpretable** numeric format\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If vocabulary is very large, OHE vectors become **very large and sparse** (mostly zeros).\n",
    "* Doesnâ€™t capture **meaning or similarity** between words (e.g., \"cat\" and \"kitten\" treated as completely different).\n",
