    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`face_classifier`**: This refers to the pre-trained Haar Cascade model (e.g., loaded using `cv2.CascadeClassifier`).\n",
    "2. **`detectMultiScale`**: A method to detect objects (in this case, faces) in an image using the cascade classifier. It returns a list of rectangles representing the bounding boxes of detected faces.\n",
    "3. **`img`**: The input image, which must be in grayscale for the detection to work correctly.\n",
    "4. **`1.3`**: The **scale factor**, which determines how much the image size is reduced at each image scale. A value of `1.3` means the classifier resizes the image to 70% of its original size at each step. Smaller values increase detection accuracy but slow down the process.\n",
    "5. **`5`**: The **minNeighbors** parameter, which specifies the minimum number of rectangles (detections) that a candidate rectangle must have to be retained. Higher values result in fewer detections but reduce false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "It detects faces in the grayscale image and returns a list of bounding box coordinates `(x, y, w, h)` for each detected face.\n",

    "---\n",

    "**for (x,y,w,h) in faces:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code crops detected faces from an image but adds some extra space around each face. Let me break it down with a simple explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it Does:\n",
    "1. **`for (x, y, w, h) in faces:`**\n",
    "   - Loops through all detected faces. Each face is a rectangle defined by:\n",
    "     - `x, y`: Top-left corner of the rectangle.\n",
    "     - `w, h`: Width and height of the rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`x = x - 10` and `y = y - 10`**\n",
    "   - Moves the top-left corner **10 pixels up and left** to add some space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`cropped_face = img[y:y+h+50, x:x+w+50]`**\n",
    "   - Crops the face from the image, but adds:\n",
    "     - **50 extra pixels below and to the right** to include more of the surrounding area.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Imagine you have an image where the detector finds a face at:\n",
    "- `x = 100, y = 100` (top-left corner of the rectangle)\n",
    "- `w = 50, h = 50` (width and height of the rectangle)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without extra space, the crop would be:\n",
    "- From `x=100` to `x=150` (width).\n",
    "- From `y=100` to `y=150` (height).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this code:\n",
    "- `x = 100 - 10 = 90` (shift left by 10 pixels).\n",
    "- `y = 100 - 10 = 90` (shift up by 10 pixels).\n",
    "- Crop includes:\n",
    "  - **Width**: From `x=90` to `x=200` (`+50 extra space` on the right).\n",
    "  - **Height**: From `y=90` to `y=200` (`+50 extra space` below).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the cropped face includes a bigger area than just the detected face, providing more context.\n",
